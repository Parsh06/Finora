# Finora

> AI-powered personal finance tracker (Vite + React + TypeScript + Firebase)

## Overview

Finora is a web app for tracking personal finances, creating budgets, scanning bills, and generating AI-driven insights. It uses React + TypeScript, Vite for bundling, Tailwind for styling, and Firebase for hosting/back-end services.

## Features

- Transaction tracking and recurring payments
- Budget management and category controls
- Bill scanner and voice transaction input
- AI-driven budget and insights components
- Analytics and export (PDF/screenshot)

## Tech stack

- Framework: React + TypeScript
- Bundler: Vite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Backend / Hosting: Firebase
- Testing: Vitest

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=16)
- npm (or pnpm/yarn)
- Firebase CLI (for deployment steps using Firebase)

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Run development server:

```
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:

```
npm run build
```

4. Preview production build locally:

```
npm run preview
```

## Useful scripts

- `npm run dev` — start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` — build production bundle
- `npm run build:prod` — verify env then build for prod
- `npm run build:dev` — build using development mode
- `npm run verify-env` — run `scripts/verify-env.js` to check required env vars
- `npm run deploy` — runs `deploy-both.ps1` (PowerShell) to deploy
- `npm run deploy:finora` — `firebase deploy --only hosting:finora`
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint
- `npm test` / `npm run test` — run Vitest tests

See `package.json` for the full list of scripts and exact behavior.

## Deployment

This repo includes deployment configs for multiple targets:

- Firebase: `firebase.json` and hosting configs
- Netlify: `netlify.toml`
- Vercel: `vercel.json`

There are helper scripts at the repo root:

- `deploy-both.ps1`, `deploy-firebase.ps1`, and `redeploy.ps1` for automated deploy flows.

## Project structure (high level)

- `src/` — application source
  - `components/` — React components (UI and pages)
  - `lib/` — integrations and utilities (Firebase, AI services)
  - `contexts/` and `hooks/` — app state and hooks
  - `pages/` — route pages
- `scripts/` — build and deployment helper scripts (e.g., `verify-env.js`)
- `public/` — static assets

## Environment

Sensitive or environment-specific values should be set according to `scripts/verify-env.js` before running `build:prod`. Check your Firebase project settings and local `.env` files (if used).

## Tests

Run unit tests with Vitest:

```
npm run test
```

## Contributing & Next steps

- Add clear CONTRIBUTING.md and issue templates if you plan to accept external contributions.
- Add CI (GitHub Actions) to run linting and tests on push.

If you'd like, I can also:

- Add a minimal `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for CI.
- Create a brief developer guide for common tasks.
